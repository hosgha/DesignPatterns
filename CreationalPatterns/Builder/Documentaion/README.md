#Builder Pattern
Builder is a creational design pattern, which **allows constructing complex objects step by step**.
The Builder design pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
Builder uses a separate class, known as the Builder, to create the complex object rather than using the object's constructor.
